### Purpose of the Image Search Web App

The image search web app was created to solve the common challenge of finding high-quality stock photos efficiently. The idea originated from personal experiences of struggling to locate suitable images for various needs, whether for websites, presentations, or personal projects. This app aims to simplify the image search process for users, providing a user-friendly interface to discover and access high-quality images quickly and effectively.
